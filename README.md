# react-to-heroku

Sets up a React app with Redux packages and deploys to Heroku.

Ideal for quickly getting a project started with zero configuration needed.

Inspired by [Mars Hall](https://gist.github.com/mars/5e01bb2a074594b44870cb087f54fe2f), [Chris Patty](https://blog.cloudboost.io/extending-create-react-app-to-make-your-own-app-generator-5d7b1ddc246), and [simple-react-app](https://github.com/Kornil/simple-react-app).

Requires a Heroku account.

## Installation and launch

```sh
npm install -g react-to-heroku
react-to-heroku my-app
```

## To do

- restyle the resulting default app
- look at React Helmet for changing page title in browser?
